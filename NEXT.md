# TEN — where the audio channel stands, and what is next

## The model, in one paragraph

An audio channel is a **cursor spawner**. Every playhead reading the take —
the loop, a key's grab, a grain — is one record in `this.cx` inside the
`ten-grsyn` worklet, rendered by one loop. A grain is a cursor with a finite
`dur`; the tape is a cursor whose window never ends. `bus` says where it
lands: 0 through the cloud's 1/sqrt(N) + gain + diffuser, 1 straight out.
When `size` is below its top the **autonomous cursor becomes a carrier** —
grains spray around where it is and it goes silent, because they are doing
its reading.

Two questions define the keys, and nothing else does:

- **keys mode** — a letter picks a POSITION (a cue) or a PITCH
- **auto** — does the loop cursor run by itself

`voice` (poly/mono/legato) says whether a key spawns a cursor, moves the
existing one, or glides it there. Freeze is pitch keys with `from: here`.
Gran is pitch keys with the loop off. None of them are modes any more.

## Where the page sits now (88cd60b)

- **Sound page**: mode · speed · [window, stretch only] · start · end · pitch ·
  key vol, then the cloud's fourteen in grain mode.
- **Instrument row**: engine · sample · keys mode · auto · loop vol · voice ·
  [from] · input · chan · gain. Nine fields, readable at a glance.
- Both levels rest at the top and only cut (SAVEV/LIBV 25).
- Every audio dial, page or row, is a mod/automation destination — one list,
  `AUDADDR()`, so a param added anywhere shows up in the matrix by itself.
- A hold ends through `endAudHold(c)`, called by the key-up, by blur, and by
  the 400ms sweep; `AUD.hold` is a view of `AUD.gk`, not a copy.

## What is next, in order

1. **THE ARP ON POLY + POSITION** — Gad still reports held keys playing nothing
   there. The twelve-cue jump had two causes (piano mapping 29e7608, channel
   transpose in slot space fac7260) and both are fixed; this is a third thing
   and it has never been diagnosed. Build the readout before touching code —
   log what `cueNote` receives from the ply delegation with poly + arp + keys
   on position, and compare against mono.

2. **Level across the size dial — PARTIALLY DONE (eddae35, d7abace).**
   Predicting it (window rms x 0.5 x sqrt(duty) x norm) took the worst case
   from 5.7x to ~3x; MEASURING it — an rms of the cloud against the take's own
   level, slewed into a compensation — did better again. Against a clean read
   of 0.318: 300ms 0.112 · 120ms 0.220 · 40ms 0.351. Long grains are still the
   quiet end. The measurement window is 24 samples strided through the take,
   which is a poor estimate of a slow-moving carrier; try integrating over a
   real span before adding more gain.

3. **Width as a stereo spread** rather than random placement per cursor.
   Whole notes are centred now (they keep the take's own stereo); grains
   still scatter, which is right for grains and wrong as a "width" control.

4. **More factory phrases** — `python3 tools/gen_samples.py <name>` re-rolls
   one, no args does the shelf. Prompts are the shelf; see the docstring for
   what to ask for (phrases, never one-shots).

## Things that will bite you

- **No backticks inside the worklet code strings.** They live in a template
  literal. A backtick in a comment breaks the whole page.
- **A long-lived browser tab lies.** After dozens of probes, panics and
  chokes it will report the cloud silent while the worklet insists grains
  are spawning — identically on HEAD and on your branch. Reload first.
- **Syntax checks pass on TDZ bugs.** `const` at line 11000 used at line 200
  parses fine and kills the keyboard at runtime. Exercise a keystroke.
- **`adjust()` wants a NUMBER as its multiplier.** `audAction(1,{})` in a probe
  writes NaN into the param, `audLive` posts the NaN to the worklet, and the
  channel outputs NaN from then on — silent, and no reload of your reasoning
  will fix it. If a bus reads NaN mid-session, reload before diagnosing.
- **Measure, do not model.** Every real bug this week was found by asking
  the running engine what its state was: audPlay's arguments logged from
  both builds, cursor positions sampled over time, the seven-case matrix
  A/B'd against the previous commit served side by side at /head-check.

## The measurement kit

`tools/stamp.sh` writes the build string; the `build` settings row fetches
the served copy to compare. The seven-case matrix (plain, sync +12, free +7,
channel select, hard pan, crop, rate 0.5) plus four cue jumps is the
regression net for anything touching the engine — run it against the
previous commit served alongside, not against remembered numbers.
